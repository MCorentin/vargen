Description: Discover and annotate variants related to phenotypes.
    VarGen is centred on the genes linked to the disease of interest in OMIM 
	(subsequently called the "OMIM genes").
    Variants are obtained from the following sources:
    - OMIM: Variants located directly on the "OMIM genes".
    - FANTOM5: Variants located on the enhancers of the "OMIM genes".
    - GTEx: Variants associated with a change in expression for 
	  the "OMIM genes", in certain tissues.
    - GWAS catalog: Variants associated with the phenotype of interest.
